Run locally: `pip install -r requirements.txt` then `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`.
Deploy: push to GitHub (these files at the repo root), open share.streamlit.io, New app, main file `streamlit_app.py`, Advanced settings, Python 3.11.
Streamlit Cloud wipes its disk on restart, so data there is temporary.


Version 3.3 (shown in the sidebar). If the sidebar does not say 3.0, you are running an old copy.

## Keeping data after deployment
Streamlit Cloud wipes local files on restart. Create a free PostgreSQL database (neon.tech or supabase.com), copy its
connection string and paste it in the app's Secrets as `DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://..."`. Accounts, subjects,
timetables, attendance and student photos are then stored in that database.

After the first admin is created the admin sign-up never appears again. Faculty sign-up is off by default; the admin can switch it on under Rules & account.
